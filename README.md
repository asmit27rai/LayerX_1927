# 🚀 LayerX - DataCoin Portal - Decentralized Data DAO 🛠️

## 🌟 Overview

LayerX is a comprehensive DataDAO platform that combines secure data storage, cryptographic verification, token economics, and decentralized governance. Users can upload their encrypted data, earn DataCoins as rewards, and use their token holdings to participate in platform governance with voting weight proportional to their stake.

## 📱 Usage Guide

### 1. **Connect Your Wallet**

- Click "Connect Wallet" to connect your MetaMask
- Ensure you're on Sepolia testnet
- The app will display your DataCoin balance and total supply

### 2. **Upload Data & Earn Tokens**

- Navigate to "Upload Data" section
- Drag and drop or select `.txt` files
- Complete Reclaim verification (or skip for testing)
- Files are encrypted and stored on IPFS
- Earn 10 DataCoins per successful upload

### 3. **Participate in Governance**

- Go to "Governance" section
- View active proposals and current voting status
- Cast votes using your DataCoin balance
- Your voting weight = your DataCoin holdings
- Watch real-time results and proposal outcomes

### 4. **Monitor Your Impact**

- Track your DataCoin balance in real-time
- See your percentage of total token supply
- View transaction history and minting records
- Monitor the DAO's total token circulation

## 🏗️ Smart Contract Details

### DataCoin Contract

- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
- **Address**: `0xa14159C1B383fBCa4A9C197aFC83E01DB4655B24`
- **Type**:  https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0xa14159c1b383fbca4a9c197afc83e01db4655b24
- **Features**: Role-based access control, vesting, and governance integration

## 🔮 Hypergraph Schema

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Hypergraph schema used in this governance application, including entity definitions, relationships, and usage examples.

## Overview

This schema implements a decentralized governance system with the following core concepts:
- DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
- Voters/Members: Participants with voting power based on token holdings
- Proposals: Governance proposals that can be voted on
- Votes: Individual voting records on proposals


## 🛡️ Why These Technologies?

**Lighthouse Web3** is essential for the DataDAO's success:

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures encrypted data storage with tamper-resistant capabilities
- **Decentralization**: IPFS-based storage removes single points of failure
- **Privacy**: Client-side encryption before upload protects user data

**Reclaim Protocol** provides crucial verification capabilities:

- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs verify data without revealing sensitive information
- **Trust**: Cryptographic verification ensures data authenticity
- **Scalability**: Efficient verification process supports platform growth

**Hypergraph** enables advanced data relationships and querying:

- **Decentralized Data Management**: Store and query complex data relationships without centralized databases
- **Schema Flexibility**: Define custom entity types and relationships for DAO components
- **Real-time Queries**: Filter and search DAO data efficiently across distributed networks
- **Interoperability**: Connect with other decentralized applications and data sources
- **Scalability**: Handle complex data operations while maintaining decentralization
